HOW TO USE:

Right click in order to see what blocks you can create.
You may adjust block properties in the property panel below.
You must place a spawn point block above each checkpoint block.
The first spawn point block (where the player starts) does not require a checkpoint block.
To give the player special abilities when switiching places you must edit the output, and, under the abilities portion, type the ability that you wish to give to the player (jumper, reset normal, etc.)
